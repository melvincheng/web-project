##About the website
The site, AllNews is a News aggregator. 
NewsAPI provides us with all the data. Then the data is parsed so that it is diplayed in a more user friendly fashion. 
The side panel can be used to jump to a specific source or category depending on the sorting method used. 
The sorting method can be changed at the top.
People can sign up to customize which sources and categories appear.
The settings menu also allows users to delete their account.
